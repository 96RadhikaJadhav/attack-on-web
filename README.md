  npm i atow
  npx atow
  ```
  
   [npx](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-npx-nodejs-package-runner) is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher.

## Why is Testing Necessary?

Human errors can cause a ***defect*** or ***failure*** at any stage of the ***software development life cycle***. The results are classified as trivial or catastrophic, depending on the consequences of the error.

The requirement of rigorous testing and their associated documentation during the software development life cycle arises because of the below reasons:

- *To identify defects*
- *To reduce flaws in the component or system*
- *Increase the overall quality of the system*
- *The testing is important since it discovers defects/bugs before the delivery to the client, which
guarantees the quality of the software.*
- *It makes the software more reliable and easy to use.*
- *Thoroughly tested software ensures reliable and high-performance software operation.*

# What is Web Application Security?

Web application security is a central component of any web-based business. The global nature of the Internet exposes web properties to attack from different locations and various levels of scale and complexity. Web application security deals specifically with the security surrounding websites, web applications and web services such as APIs.

## What is Web Application Security Testing?

From web-based email to online shopping and  banking, organizations are bringing their businesses directly to customers' web browsers every day, circumventing the need for complex installations or update rollouts. Additionally, organizations are rolling out internal web applications for finance, marketing automation,and even internal communication that are often homegrown, or at least fine-tuned for their particular needs.

While web applications offer convenience to businesses and customers alike, their ubiquity makes them a popular attack target for cybercriminals. As a result, web application security testing, or 
scanning and testing web applications for risk, is essential.
